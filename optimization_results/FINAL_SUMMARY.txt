CETACEAN CLASSIFICATION - FINAL RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================
Date: December 23, 2025
Total Experiments: 24 (15 November + 9 December)

BEST MODEL: exp3_max_seq_balanced
---------------------------------
Test Accuracy: 99.49%
K12 Accuracy:  96.2% (+10.7% vs November)
K14 Accuracy:  83.3% (+20.8% vs November)

Configuration:
- Backbone: ResNet18 (from scratch)
- Sequence Length: 1000ms
- Loss: Label Smoothing (0.1)
- Sampling: sqrt_inverse_freq with 1.5x K12/K14 boost
- Batch Size: 64
- Learning Rate: 0.0003
- Scheduler: OneCycle

KEY FINDINGS:
1. 1000ms sequence length is optimal (longer sequences did NOT help)
2. Label smoothing (0.1) beats focal loss and cross-entropy
3. sqrt_inverse_freq sampling with moderate boost (1.5x) is optimal
4. ResNet18 outperforms ResNet34 and ConvNeXt
5. Training from scratch beats ImageNet pretraining for spectrograms

WHAT DIDN'T WORK:
- Focal loss (noise class collapse)
- MixUp/SpecAugment (training instability)
- Aggressive class weighting (3x+)
- Longer sequences (1200ms, 1500ms)
- Larger models (ResNet34)

Per-Class Results (Best Model):
K1: 99.5%  K3: 97.6%  K4: 98.1%  K5: 99.7%  K7: 100.0%
K10: 98.1% K12: 96.2% K13: 100.0% K14: 83.3% K17: 100.0%
K21: 93.9% K27: 100.0% noise: 99.9%
