################
###PREDICTION_DIR = Directory where the input prediction file(s) are stored (only prediction files, no other files allowed).
################
prediction_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###OUTPUT_DIR = Directory where the annotation files (per prediction file) are stored.
################
output_dir=/*USER-SPECIFIC-DIRECTORY*/

################
###THRESHOLD = network confidence threshold, which has to be higher than this particular defined threshold in order to consider
###a network hypothesis as true/valid. Everything below will be conisdered as noise. Typically this threshold should be the same
###as the threshold during network prediction, however, a different can also be chosen, while building the annotation file.
###If this is the case the prediction and annotation file might be different due to the different threshold
################
threshold=0.85

################
###NOISE_IN_ANNO = If this flag is set, also the noise segments will be stored within the annotation file. Otherwise only
###animal vocalizations will be named within the annoation file (all classes independent of noise).
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
noise_in_anno=false

################
###USE_PROBABILITY_PRIORITY = When enabled (default), overlapping predictions are resolved by selecting
###the chunk with the HIGHEST PROBABILITY, not the earliest one. This fixes an issue where earlier
###chunks would incorrectly override later chunks with higher confidence scores.
###Activate (=true) versus Deactivate (=false).
################
use_probability_priority=true

################
###MIN_ANNOTATION_DURATION = Minimum duration (in seconds) for an annotation to be included in the output.
###Annotations shorter than this value will be filtered out. Set to 0 to keep all annotations.
###This helps filter out very short spurious detections.
################
min_annotation_duration=0.1

################
###MERGE_GAP = Maximum gap (in seconds) between adjacent annotations of the same class to merge them.
###Annotations of the same class that are separated by less than this gap will be merged into one.
###Set to 0 to disable merging.
################
merge_gap=0.15
